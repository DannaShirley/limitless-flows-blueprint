## **Limitless Blueprint - flows**
This Limitless Blueprint provides instructions for integrating Limitless into Genesys Cloud using one of the following flow types:

- Open Messaging
- Chat
- Email

By using these flows, open messaging, chat or email channels in Genesys Cloud can be connected to Limitless APIs, bringing GigCX Experts into the conversation through the Limitless SmartCrowd platform. 

The flows perform the following functions:

- Routing of conversations to Expert Crowd
- Integration between Genesys Cloud and the Limitless SmartCrowd platform
- Facilitating the conversation between Customer and GigCX Expert
- Manages the lifecycle/status events coming from the SmartCrowd platform and routes accordingly within Genesys
- Brings a Genesys Agent into the conversation if the Expert Crowd is unable to help the Customer

A high-level representation of the implementation can be seen in the diagram.
